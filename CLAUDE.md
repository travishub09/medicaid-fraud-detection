# CLAUDE.md

Project memory for Claude Code. Read this first; it is the contract for how to work
in this repository.

## What this project is

A **Healthcare Fraud Whistleblower Origination platform**: an intelligence-and-
acquisition engine for qui tam (False Claims Act) cases. Public healthcare data finds
*where* fraud signal concentrates (Model A), people/role data finds *who* plausibly
witnessed it and converts them into compliant marketing audiences (Model B), and an
underwriting model decides *which* resulting cases are worth financing (Model C) —
all on a shared healthcare entity-resolution graph, under a strict legal frame.

The full strategy is in `docs/platform/` (start at `docs/platform/README.md`). The
source strategy document lives on branch `docs/source-pdfs` (confidential — never
copy its text wholesale into committed files).

**Operating thesis to never violate:** public data finds defendants and corroborates;
it does **not** make the legal claim. The human insider (the relator) is the asset.
Outputs are *investigative leads and marketing audiences for human/counsel review* —
never accusations, never adjudications about people.

## Repository layout

```
src/attempt_2/      CURRENT detection pipeline (13 stages) — the production core
  clean_data.py       stage 1 + THE shared normalizers (NPI Luhn, name, address)
  ingest/             integrate.py (assertion-driven integration), features.py
  audit/              coverage diagnostic, $21.8T corruption quarantine
  leads/              3-layer detection, layer-2 v3 concepts, company rollup/tracker
  export/             final CSVs
src/attempt_1/      DEPRECATED first pipeline — reference only, do not extend
src/backtest/       LEIE temporal validation (2.0× top-decile lift) — the proof
src/entity_graph/   canonical entity graph (nodes/edges/features/rings) — BUILT, tested
src/model_a/        org fraud-risk → ERV (scaffold; will absorb leads/ core)
src/model_b/        whistleblower id/propensity (scaffold; scheme-role matrix populated)
src/model_c/        case underwriting (scaffold)
src/lookup_tool/    public billing-risk lookup (scaffold)
src/sourcing/       WARN surge monitor (built); docket monitor (stub)
src/ingest_cms/     Part B / Part D / DMEPOS adapters + peer percentiles (built)
src/enforcement/    DOJ case DB parser + derived sector priors (fetcher stub)
tests/              pytest; fixtures/synthetic.py generates data — no data files committed
docs/platform/      architecture, roadmap, and component specs (the source of truth)
```

## Commands

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Detection pipeline (needs real data in ~/Desktop/data/preclean/; see README)
python -m src.attempt_2.ingest.integrate            # stages run in README order

# Entity graph
python -m src.entity_graph --input ~/Desktop/data/processed --out ~/Desktop/data/graph
python -m src.entity_graph --fixture --out /tmp/graph_out    # synthetic, no real data

# Tests (work without any real data)
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Hard rules (enforced in code — keep them enforced)

1. **Identifiers are strings.** NPIs, PAC IDs, CCNs, ZIPs keep leading zeros. CSVs are
   read as all-VARCHAR Parquet first. Never let pandas infer numeric on an ID.
2. **Assertions hard-fail.** Every join asserts row-count and dollar conservation and
   RAISES on failure — never warn-and-continue. New stages must do the same.
3. **No fan-out.** Dollars are attributed via BILLING NPI only; joins are many-to-one
   by construction and asserted.
4. **Quarantine, never delete.** Bad rows go to a quarantine table with a reason.
5. **Explainability is mandatory.** Every score ships with named drivers. No bare,
   unexplainable composite ever reaches an output. (Defamation safety + counsel
   credibility depend on this.)
6. **Reuse the shared normalizers** in `src/attempt_2/clean_data.py`
   (`canonicalize_series`, `_normalize_name`, `_standardize_address`). Do not write
   a second name normalizer.
7. **HIPAA: no data in git.** `.gitignore` blocks `*.csv`/`*.parquet`/`*.xlsx`. Test
   data is *generated* by `tests/fixtures/synthetic.py`. Never force-add data files.
8. **One-sided robust statistics.** Fraud signals use peer-relative robust z
   (median/MAD, 1.4826 factor), one-sided (only excess is suspicious), clipped;
   guard zero-MAD peer groups. Public-facing numbers are percentiles, not z-scores.

## Legal guardrails (these shape code design — see docs/platform/01-legal-compliance.md)

- Model B outputs **audiences (role × org × channel), never named-individual call
  lists**. `person_priority` stays internal. FCRA risk if outputs adjudicate people.
- The "likely whistleblower at employer X" inference is **sensitive from creation**:
  minimize retention, never expose it in exports.
- The lookup tool returns percentiles + drivers + benign explanations — **no fraud
  boolean, no accusations**.
- Never build a hard dependency on data we cannot lawfully use (T-MSIS RIF DUAs and
  proprietary claims licenses bar litigation-targeting; see docs/platform/02).
- Intake collects no PHI at top of funnel; never encourage unauthorized access to
  employer systems or documents.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+, DuckDB for heavy joins, pandas for orchestration/assertions, Parquet
  everywhere; NetworkX for graph features (no Neo4j dependency — export is a stub).
- Stages are CLI modules: `python -m src.<pkg>.<module>` with argparse; idempotent;
  read-only on inputs; write outputs + a Markdown report (`QA_REPORT.md` pattern).
- Node ids are namespaced strings: `provider:<npi>`, `org:<company_id>`,
  `owner:<key>`, `exclusion:<row>`.
- Scaffold modules raise `NotImplementedError` citing their spec doc; replace the
  raise, keep the docstring contract.
- Data flows: `~/Desktop/data/preclean/` (raw) → `interim/` → `processed/` →
  `features/` → `detection/` → `graph/`. Override with CLI flags; never hardcode
  new absolute paths.

## Current state & what's next

- **Built:** integration + corruption audit + 3-layer detection + company rollup +
  LEIE backtest (`attempt_2`, `backtest`); entity graph (`entity_graph`); Model A v1
  ERV composite + sector priors + target dossiers (`model_a`); WARN surge monitor
  (`sourcing`). Full suite: `pytest tests/` (32 tests).
- **Next increments:** run adapters/exposure against real procured files; Open
  Payments adapter (kickback correlation); DOJ fetcher + 10-year backfill; docket
  monitor; Model B person-resolver (gated on people-data license).
- **Gated on data/licensing:** person↔employer resolution (people-data vendors, FCRA
  review), Model C labels (DOJ/PACER case DB), `refers_to`/`pays` edges.
- See `docs/platform/ROADMAP.md` for the full phase plan and
  `docs/platform/09-data-procurement.md` for exactly what data to acquire and why.

## Git

- Work on feature branches; `main` is protected history. The pre-platform original
  build is pinned at branch `original-build` / tag `pre-platform-snapshot`.
- Commit author must be `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Raw data, PDFs of the confidential strategy, and derived parquet never go to git
  (the strategy PDF lives only on the dedicated `docs/source-pdfs` branch).
